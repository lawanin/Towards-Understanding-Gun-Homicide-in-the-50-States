Notes:

FBI Crime Data
-Most Footnotes that are removed have to do with changing definitions of rape 
and sodomy
-2011: Alabama and Montana footnote which reports changed reporting practices 
and so incompatibility of previous years' data. Does this mean everything after
2011 should not be used for these states? The figure is 301 murders and 273 in the
previous year in Alabama. For Montana, the respective figures are 28 and 26. 
These definitely seems comparable...
-2010: Ilinois and Oregon footnote which reports changed reporting practices and so 
incompatibility of previous years' data. In 2009, Illinois footnote which 
reports that figures are estimates because  only counties over 100,000 reported 
in FBI compatible way. Is this the reason for the 2010 footnote? No, vide 2008.
The respectivefigures are 706 and 773. For Oregon, respective figures are 91 and
85.
-2009: Vide supra for Illinois. Kentucky and Michigan footnote which reports 
changed reporting practices and so incompatibility of previous years' data. For Kentucky, 
the respectives figure are 178 and 198. For Michigan, the respective figures are
627 and 542. 
-2008: Ilionois footnote which reports that figures are estimates because counties 
over 100,000 reported in FBI compatiable way.
-2007: Ilionois footnote which reports that figures are estimates because counties 
over 100,000 reported in FBI compatiable way.
-2006: Ilionois footnote which reports that figures are estimates because counties 
over 100,000 reported in FBI compatiable way.
-2005: Ilionois footnote which reports that figures are estimates because counties
